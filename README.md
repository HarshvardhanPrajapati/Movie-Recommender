# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommender System  

This is my first **Machine Learning** project: a **Movie Recommender System** that suggests similar movies based on cosine similarity. The project includes both a structured machine learning model and a simple interactive web interface built using Flask.

## ðŸ“š Features  
- **Movie Recommendations**: Suggests similar movies based on user input.  
- **Machine Learning**: Built using text vectorization to create a similarity matrix.  
- **Backend**: Flask-powered web interface for user interaction.  
- **Extensibility**: Designed for easy modification and collaboration.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Enhancements  
Iâ€™m open to feedback and collaboration! Hereâ€™s how you can contribute:  
- **Enhance the UI**: Add CSS to improve the websiteâ€™s look and feel.
- **Search bar**: Enhance the search bar by providing movie suggestions as users type, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Expand the Dataset**: Add more movies for better recommendations.  
- **Optimize the Backend**: Make the Flask server more robust and scalable.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Fork the repository and make sure to activate and switch to the virtual environment `venv`.
2. Install all the required files: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Create all the necessary files, as the repository does not contain model.pkl because its size was too large to post on GitHub: ```python src/components/data_ingestion.py```
4. After running the above command, all necessary files will be created, and by now, you should be in the virtual environment.
5. Run the application and navigate to the localhost on your PC: ```python app.py```
